# Swift Mobile Applications
This repository contains a ToDo App written in `Swift` using `SwiftData` and `SwiftUI`

## About
The app was created as a part of the Mobile Applications course and was being written in [stages](https://github.com/lursz/MobileApps/blob/labs/). Presented here is the final version of the app. Functionalities include, but are not limited to:
- Adding tasks
- Deleting tasks (swipe to delete)
- Editing tasks
- Marking tasks as completed
- Task priority
- Task due date
- Task deadine
- Various informational views

## Installation
To run the app, you need to have `Xcode` installed on your machine. You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).  
All of Linux users are unfortunately out of luck, as `Xcode` is only available on macOS. I also strongly discourage using MacOS virtual machines, as the performance is horrendous. The only semi-viable option (still with major drawbacks) is to use [GitHub Actions with a Xcode CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/lursz/MobileApps/blob/main/.github/workflows/on_push.yaml).
